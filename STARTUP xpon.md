## Upstairs
- turn on lamps in hall:
two red lights behind well opened door. those. that’s all.
it will take a while. 
attention: if turned off, it will take a while until light is bright again!
same is valid for light in cellar.

- put „gallery open“ sign outside above door with clamps.
and put „pls. knock if nobody upstairs“-sign from next to doorwindow to behind doorwindow

- put ventilator in open door. for fresh air (corona!) and stopping entering the gallery without mask and/or valid papers. you will have less discussion. 
it has three levels (three knobs at the back, the fourth is on/off)
and is very powerful.
turn it off if you are upstairs and don’t like the noise.

attention:
- before you go in the basement - EVERY time nobody is upstairs - lock the door. just turn the knob. we have a nice neighbourhood, but we also have a „nice“ neighbourhood


## Corona
- there is nothing upstairs at this exhibition. we close the door for better air (jan smokes). the toilet is there, but not public due to corona

- jan is vaccinated as all of us. he might be there or not. you won’t know until he appears (mostly, he appears to make a coffee). he is the ghost. 

- for the same reason (corona), we can’t sell drinks at the bar
but we can drink outside with guests… ;)

- there should be enough change in the tin on the counter

- contact data (one person/household per piece of paper) we collect under the counter above the subwoofer. we tacker them together daily. we need to check the vac or test.. no vac or test or fakes each day…


##  Downstairs:
- one lamp at the stairs. plug in plug in plug. above your head.

- turn on the light in whole cellar. two „sicherungsschalter“ above your head on left side. one after steeldoor, one after next wall in corridor. 

- Drain water from compressor (little black thingie in small storage room) with screw at bottom and switch it on
ATTENTION - Arca relies on this!

- Open windows.
start at far end so you have ladder nearer after 

- Close far area with rope


##  Painting
-take off covering from paint, put it on box at computer
be careful, paint is still wet
- carefully remove painting from Arka. use cutter if needed (at box)
be careful, paint is still wet
- put painting on wall using clamps.
be careful, paint is still wet
- refill paint (at box)
add water (should be a bottle at box)
stir
don’t shake
(stick is at box, paper inside to clean as well)


##  ARKA hardware switch on
- did you empty and turn on the compressor?
- Switch on KUKA mains switch (back of rack, green, security knob)
- SmartPad 
  - Turn key, switch to EXT mode, turn key back
  - Tap "0" button on top, switch on drives.
(says it won’t work, and won’t turn green, but will work)
this will take while, that’s why first.


## ARKA computer switch on
large MacBook Pro.
load project. It is open, but won’t run unless opened again.
click „Hamburg-01.json“ and load it again in dialog

- Hamburg xpon-art:
    ```
    python tbl2json.py https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BTUcaonniEF3Fmb19ldBlSeylyghuEIvVK9wKNdwFXI C:\Users\markus\Desktop\Nessun-Dorma-Stories\Hamburg-01.json

click connect

## Projector
turn on with remote.
you will hear a loud sound if you made it


## Putzini switch-on
- disconnect charger
- disconnect charger for loudspeaker and connect it to orientation-stickie
- Make sure the internal loudspeaker is switched on (button on the far side) and connected (3.5" jack)
- Switch on the logic boards (upper lever switch up!)
- Switch on the drive board (lower push button: "upwards pitched" sound!)


## Putzini (and music) computer
small MacBook Pro on the left
- brighten display (with fn-key)
- log in. user `antonie`, pw `20L07`.
- you will have to restart Putzini from the command line terminal (`iTerm`):
### Tab 4 (Putzini)
Start by 
```
ssh putzini@putzini
```
After a short while, the command prompt should change to `putzini@jetputz:~$`.
You are now on Putzini's internal computer.
The next step depends on whether Putzini is already running (see above) or you start it for the first time.
- run 
    ```tmux```
    A green bar wil appear at the bottom. Now, run
    ```
    cd nessundorma
    ./hover.py
    ``` 
    ...it will now print a lot of status messages, run some tests, drive the neck down to zero position, do a quick nod with the head, reset the LEDs etc. Finally, you should see Putzini's position and direction properly in the status window. Putzini is now ready to go!


## Putzini operation test
if ARKA is set, you can use the arrow keys to move Putzini
...using the graphical interface (other application)


## Raspberry Pi for Projector
should automatically switch on and be properly configured... mostly (see below).
..._except_ it wll not play sound unless you do one mouse click.
To do so, start `VNC Viewer` on the small MacBook, connect to the Raspberry Pi, and click once.
be aware you won’t see text in the beginning, don’t worry
you can check..at some tab..hm


## start the show
now press play at arka computer
but
always rewind first.

there have been move tests, but they won’twork. eventually, because drives are not turned on, but in automatic mode? doesn#t matter, though. the show works.


## tidyup
close near area with rope
Put ladder back in storage.
if door to storage room is open, close with the screw. it’s our alarm-system because one can hear it very well.


## enjoy the show
(if it interrupts, rewind project at arka computer and press play again. it’s a loop and might stop at the repeating points)


## ARKA hardware switch off
- Unity control software: click "disconnect" -> ARKA's socket turns orange
- SmartPad: 
  - turn key, set to T1, turn key back
  - "User" button -> Administrator, pw kuka -> log on
  - Top left corner button -> Shutdown -> "Shut down control PC" -> Yes
  - 
- Switch off power supply mains !!!


## Putzini switch-off
- Switch off drive board (lower push button: "downwards pitched" sound)
- Switch off logic board (upper lever switch down)
- open Putzini and turn off speaker (button far side) - Take care not to damage the vacuum cleaner and/or the antenna when opening Putzini (or take them off)
- Charge speaker using USB-C cable hanging out. Use cable from orientation-stickie on wall left from computers. take it off, no fear
- Attach main charger to external jack.
- If required, attach vacuum cleaner charger. Every 2-3 days?
- Goodnight.


## Switch off compressor, drain water


## fetch ladder and close windows
simply keep it at window opposite the computers, so you remember tomorrow


## paint afterwork
- cover paint with foils
- unscrew mounting of brush (4 screws), wash it upstairs, put it on again
- sign painting (see last at wall. count up one number: x+1/y)
pencil and tool ate at the box as well.
 
## if it’s warm outside, keep storage door closed.
if it’s cold, open it to heat cellar.

## don’t forget to put gallery sign back inside
and the other one from the doorwindow back to behind the door next to window
