## Putzini
- Gets stuck/crashes because of pending publish call error messages. Probably a runaway process because warnings get broadcasted via MQTT themselves.

## Lasers
- Sporadically do not work in Hamburg (when remaining on red light for a while?) --> Robert has a video.

## Projector/Sound
- OS on Pi is too old for Python 3.6 which seems required -> Update? Replace with Pi4?
